          A pond is an area filled with water, either natural or artificial,
          that is smaller than a lake. It may arise naturally in floodplains as
          part of a river system, or be a somewhat isolated depression (such as
          a kettle, vernal pool, or prairie pothole). It may contain shallow
          water with marsh and aquatic plants and animals.

          Factors that affect the type of life found in a pond include depth and
          duration of water level, nutrients, shade, presence or absence of
          inlets and outlets, effects of grazing animals, and salinity.

          Ponds are frequently man-made, or expanded beyond their original depth
          and bounds. Among their many uses, ponds provide water for agriculture
          and livestock, aid in habitat restoration, serve as fish hatcheries,
          are components of landscape architecture, may store thermal energy as
          solar ponds, and treat wastewater as treatment ponds.
